For the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) assignment, our group developed a comprehensive website design for Makaan Bistro, a restaurant aiming to expand its business online. The project involved creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface that incorporates features such as an online menu, table reservation system, pre-order options, online payment methods, and customer feedback mechanisms. We focused on key usability principles like memorability, learnability, consistency, and error prevention to ensure a seamless user experience. The design included sketches, prototypes, and user evaluations to refine the interface and functionality based on feedback and usability testing.
